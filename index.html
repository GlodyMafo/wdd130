        <p>My name is Glody Mafo Kisanga, a software development student at Brigham Young University, currently based in
            Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo. Passionate about web development and graphic design, I combine
            creativity with technical expertise to bring original ideas to life. I’m skilled in tools like Adobe
            Illustrator, Photoshop, and essential web programming languages, always aiming to deliver modern and
            visually appealing solutions.
            Proactive and detail-oriented, I thrive in collaborative and multicultural environments where I can adapt
            quickly, grow my skills, and take on new challenges.</p>

        <img src="images/Lubumbashi.jpg" alt="Lubumbashi">
        <p>Lubumbashi, often called "Lushi," is the second-largest city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located
            in the southeastern province of Haut-Katanga. It is a major industrial and mining center, especially known
            for its vast reserves of copper and cobalt. This mineral wealth makes Lubumbashi an economic hub, attracting
            mining companies and investors from around the world.

            The city features colonial architecture from the Belgian era, with landmarks like the Saints Peter and Paul
            Cathedral and the historic Post Office building. Lubumbashi is also home to many green spaces, such as the
            Lubumbashi Zoo, and hosts prominent academic institutions like the University of Lubumbashi (UNILU), which
            draws students from across the country.

            With its vibrant cultural scene, bustling markets, and ethnic diversity, Lubumbashi combines modernity and
            tradition, offering a fascinating insight into life in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
